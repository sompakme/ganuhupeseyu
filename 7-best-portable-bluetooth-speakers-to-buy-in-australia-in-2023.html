We find out what factors make a good product by talking to experts, reviewing test results and analysing thousands of customer reviews.</p><h2><b>OUR TOP PICKS</b></h2><h3><b>In this article</b></h3><h2><b id=U7021947760088oG>OUR TOP PICK OF PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3, from $249 (down from $329) at Myer</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3 may not be the most premium speaker on the market, but it ticks so many boxes that it remains our top pick for most people. Battery life? Up to 20 hours. Durability? An IP67-rating that will see it survive water, dust and accidental drops. Audio? Big, 360-degree sound with plenty of bass.</p><p>Add to that a great range of colour options and the ability to pair it with older Boom and Megaboom models for stereo sound, and it’s easy to see why the speaker is so popular.</p><p>On the downside, the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Megaboom 3</a> is bigger than some other models on this list, and it doesn’t have voice assistance or any other smart features. If you’re looking for consistent audio, or a model that can survive your next pool party though, the Megaboom 3 is hard to go past.</p><p>One five-star reviewer on Myer called it the “best speaker around”, saying they’ve dropped it “in the ocean, the pool, the bath, the shower and (it’s) always fine”.</p><h2><b id=U702194776008VDD>BEST PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER FOR BATTERY</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>JBL Charge 5, $169.96 (down from $199.95) at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>JBL knows how to make a great portable speaker and the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Charge 5</a> might just be our favourite so far. Offering a great blend of size, price and performance, the hardy speaker offers balanced sound and deep bass that’s much bigger than its size would suggest.</p><p>Its IP67-rating makes it nice and durable for outdoor use, and puts it up there with UltimateEars Megaboom 3 (above) as one the best outdoor speakers around. While it isn’t the most compact portable model available, it is still a convenient size to throw in a backpack and take on your next picnic or bike ride.</p><p>Equipped with up to 20 hours of battery life and the ability to pair with other JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers, the Charge 5 is also a great party speaker at a reasonable price. We also love the built-in USB-A port, which allows you to keep your phone charged up so you can play your tunes for longer.</p><h2><b id=U702194776008E2C>BEST SMART PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Sonos Roam, $299 at The Good Guys</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>If you’re after a hands-free listening experience, the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Sonos Roam</a> comes highly recommended. Fitted with both Alexa and the Google Assistant, you can play, pause, adjust and change your music from the other side of the room. There's also both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so you can pair the Roam with other Sonos speakers for a multi-room audio experience.</p><p>The Roam is the most compact speaker option by the brand, making it a top choice for those who want Sonos’ great sound in a much smaller package. It also comes in a range of colour options and has an Auto TruePlay function feature that adjusts the sound to suit your surroundings.</p><p>The battery life isn’t as long as most other models on this list, though it should still be enough to get you through your next beach trip or pool party. The speaker is also on the pricey side, but its smart features could make it well worth the spend.</p><h2><b id=U702194776008LQE>BEST PORTABLE HOME BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Sonos Move, $699 at The Good Guys</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>Sonos’ Move is something of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it’s one of the best smart speakers around. On the other, the build of the speaker is so big and heavy that it doesn’t really make sense as the ‘portable’ option it’s marketed as.</p><p>If you do decide to lug it around with you, you can still take advantage of Sonos’ wide support for music services, and the Auto TruePlay function which adjusts the sound depending on your location. There’s also an IP56 rating for dust and water resistance and a built-in handle to make it a little easier to carry.</p><p>Use the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Move</a> at home and you’ll get excellent voice assistance that performs well at a distance with built-in support for Alexa and Google Assistant. Move out of Wi-Fi range and you’ll lose the smart functions of the speaker, but still have Bluetooth to fall back on, making it a truly versatile option.</p><p>When you’re done for the day, you can also drop the speaker into the handy wireless charging cradle to ensure it’s fired up and ready to go for your next listening session. Ultimately, there’s plenty to like here, even if it does perform better as a home speaker.</p><h2><b id=U702194776008mYD>BEST WATERPROOF PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 3, $129 (down from $149) at Myer</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>During my years working at a popular electronics store, we had a hard time keeping UE’s Wonderbooms on the shelf – especially over summer. Fitted with an IP67-rating and the ability to float, the ultraportable speaker has long been one of the best waterproof speakers around.</p><p>Now into its third generation, the Wonderboom has an even longer Bluetooth range (40m up from 33m) and a slight uptick in battery life (14 hours, up from 13), giving it a small but appreciated upgrade. Like its predecessors, it also comes in a variety of fun colour options and has a durable, lightweight design.</p><p>Defying its compact size, the little speaker provides big, bassy 360-sound and can also be paired with another <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Wonderboom 3</a> to double the audio offering, making it great for parties and listening outdoors.</p><p>It doesn’t have many customisation options and it is missing the USB-C charging we expect to see these days, but it remains a truly portable option with surprisingly loud audio.</p><h2><b id=U702194776008Er>BEST BOSE PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Bose SoundLink Flex, $212.46 (down from $249.95) at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>Thanks to its rugged nature, waterproof rating and detailed audio, <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Bose’s SoundLink Flex</a> is one of the most popular portable speakers on the market. Featuring PositionIQ technology, the compact model automatically detects whether it’s upright, laying down or hanging from its integrated loop and optimises the audio so you don’t have to fiddle with the settings.</p><p>It’s also one of the best outdoor speakers around, thanks to its steel grille, silicone exterior, and IP67-rating that allows it to be dropped, splashed and even dunked in water for short periods of time.</p><p>While the speaker doesn’t have built-in voice assistant support, you can pair it with a smartphone to control it with your voice. There’s also a speakerphone so you can take calls when connected to your phone via Bluetooth.</p><p>It doesn’t quite live up to the “room-filling sound” promised by the brand, but it is compact and rugged enough to be a great ‘go-anywhere’ companion.</p><p>One reviewer on Google Reviews, who rated the Flex five out of five, called it “a versatile gem in the world of audio gadgets”.</p><p>Its compact size is a big win, making it ultra-portable without compromising on sound quality. The rich, deep bass and crisp highs it delivers are surprisingly impressive for its size.”</p><h2><b id=U702194776008qoB>BEST JBL PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>JBL Flip 6, $143.65 (down from $169.95) at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What you need to know</b></p><p>While the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Charge 5</a> (above) is our favourite JBL speaker overall, the Flip 6 is a close second. Arriving in a similar design to its predecessor, the Flip 6 doesn’t look overly different on the outside. On the inside, however, both a 10-watt tweeter and dustproof rating have been added, effectively improving the sound quality as well as the overall design.</p><p>It now also comes with the long overdue addition of an equaliser through the accompanying app, making it even easier to achieve great sound. Like the Flip 5, the Flip 6 comes in an array of different colour options and boasts a battery life of up to 12 hours, making it a top-choice whether you’re listening at home or outdoors.</p><h3><b id=U702194776008ij>HOW TO CHOOSE A PORTABLE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER</b></h3><p>Portable speakers come in a range of shapes, sizes and price brackets, making it tricky to work out which one you should buy. To help you narrow it down, here are a few things you should consider before making a purchase:</p><p><b>Portability:</b> Some speaker models are more portable than others, so really think about how small and lightweight you need yours to be. If it’s for hiking, go compact; if it’s for indoor use, consider a slightly larger model for better sound.</p><p><b>Battery:</b> If you plan on taking your speaker outside a lot, make sure it has the battery life to match. For indoor use, this becomes less crucial as you can just plug it in as needed.</p><p><b>Sound quality:</b> Smaller speakers might be easier to carry, but larger models often have better audio. Weigh up each model’s ability to produce clear and balanced sound with how convenient it is to move around.</p><p><b>Durability:</b> If you plan on using your speaker outdoors, make sure you choose a model that can handle it. Look for a speaker with a dust and water resistance rating (also known as an IP rating) and a durable exterior that won’t easily break.</p><p><b>Wireless Range:</b> Simply put: the longer the Bluetooth range, the more freedom you have to move around while staying connected.</p><p><b>Extra features:</b> If you’ve got your heart set on extra features like built-in voice assistants, double check the product listing to make sure these are included.</p><p><b>Price:</b> Keep your budget in mind. While there are always exceptions, lower-priced models typically won’t offer the same audio quality or features as higher-priced options. If you are shopping on a budget, we recommend reading customer reviews to determine the limitations of each model before you buy.</p><p><b>More best audio coverage</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=8fb43b577c6f1d3147bb16f7bc214b01 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best smart speakers</a></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p><a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=725bd26418cb12447ebfa660f093048f data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best soundbars</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=5234df1f76314bebc27d3bb8d6e1f282 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best earbuds for sleeping</a></p><p>Looking for more great deals?

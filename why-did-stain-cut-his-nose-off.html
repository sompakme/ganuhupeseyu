He apparently cut it off after Knuckleduster from the Vigilantes spin-off series smashed it to pieces, but we're not sure why he felt that was necessary.<h2>What did MHA Stain do?</h2>Stain's Quirk is called "Blood Curdle" and allows him to paralyze his victims after ingesting blood. The length of time he can keep his opponents paralyzed depends on their blood type. The order of most to least resistant blood types pertaining to Stain's quirk goes O, A, AB, B.<h2>Why did Stain become a villain MHA?</h2>He believes that those who become Heroes for fame or money are unworthy of being called the name and only All Might is a true hero. Due to his strong ideology, he took it upon himself to become the Hero Killer: Stain to stain his own hands with blood to purge fake heroes and change the current society.<h2>Why does Deku look like Stain?</h2>Both individuals are rejected and neglected by society. Civilians don't perceive Deku anymore either as a hero or a vigilante.

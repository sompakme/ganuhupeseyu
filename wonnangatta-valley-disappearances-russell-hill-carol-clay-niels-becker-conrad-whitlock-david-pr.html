He has not been charged.</p><p>Mr Watson-Munro – who has gained the trust of some of Australia’s scariest crooks, including Julian Knight and Alphonse Gangitano, in his line of work – said past cases deserved a chance to be re-examined.</p><p>He also said latest police tactics used in the case of the Wonnangatta campers, but also in the search for William Tyrell in NSW and in the remarkable discovery of four-year-old Cleo Smith in Western Australia, increased the chances of a breakthrough.</p><p>“It’s about the use of technology in forensic investigations now. Police can really see things now that the naked eye can’t – there’s no such thing as real privacy anymore.”</p><p>Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper – tasked with the mighty effort to find Mr Hill and Ms Clay – said the Wonnangatta valley had “quite a history”, with the first mystery disappearance well over a hundred years ago.</p><p>Sometime in December 1917 or January 1918, the manager of the Wonnangatta cattle station, James Barclay, was shot dead.</p><p>The station cook John Banford was suspected of the murder, but in November of 1918 he was also found dead with a bullet lodged in his skull.</p><p>The murders have remained unsolved for the past century.</p><p>“The place has quite a mysterious history,” Inspector Stamper said.</p><p>“There were some murders back there well over a hundred years ago and there have been some other disappearances in the broader area of the high country – we haven’t identified any connections between any of those.”</p><p>A coronial inquest into the 2019 case of Conrad Whitlock deemed he had died on or about the time police first started searching for him.</p><p>“The evidence does not enable me to determine the precise place of Mr Whitlock‘s death, the medical cause of his death, or the circumstances in which he died beyond the fact that he drove away from his home in the early hours of July 30, 2019,” Coroner Paresa Spanos ruled.</p><p>A Coroner in a separate inquest into the 2011 disappearance of David Prideaux found it likely the ex-Barwon Prison boss died from a serious accident in the national park or a medical cause, and there was nothing to suggest he met with foul play.</p><p>In both cases, the causes of probable death remain unknown, while there has not yet been a coronial inquest into the 2019 disappearance of Niels Becker.<br></p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Melbourne data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Melbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwwsicq6iqmZZ8pL7Ippxon6KatG642KelZpmip7K0wMSdZKiulad6pbXSmqepnZGnrq%2BvxGamn2WiqsC0sculZKGhnKF6orrDZpqaqp%2BheqS4wLJknKqZoravu8uonqKrpKh6tK3YZpmrnZGgwam%2Bzq6eoWWjpa6zt9Jmn6iolWKzsL6Mq5ysp5yqwaq7zWagp2WglsC1ecKaqp6rX6OyuL%2BMrKuoqqlkfniyxZ1ncWhobYB1rsNybmtvZZt9dYPBcm5rnZJtgKQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html&text=Wonnangatta%20valley%20disappearances%3a%20Russell%20Hill%2c%20Carol%20Clay%2c%20Niels%20Becker%2c%20Conrad%20Whitlock%2c%20David%20Pr&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html&title=Wonnangatta%20valley%20disappearances%3a%20Russell%20Hill%2c%20Carol%20Clay%2c%20Niels%20Becker%2c%20Conrad%20Whitlock%2c%20David%20Pr" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html&title=Wonnangatta%20valley%20disappearances%3a%20Russell%20Hill%2c%20Carol%20Clay%2c%20Niels%20Becker%2c%20Conrad%20Whitlock%2c%20David%20Pr" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html&title=Wonnangatta%20valley%20disappearances%3a%20Russell%20Hill%2c%20Carol%20Clay%2c%20Niels%20Becker%2c%20Conrad%20Whitlock%2c%20David%20Pr" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwonnangatta-valley-disappearances-russell-hill-carol-clay-niels-becker-conrad-whitlock-david-pr.html&description=Wonnangatta%20valley%20disappearances%3a%20Russell%20Hill%2c%20Carol%20Clay%2c%20Niels%20Becker%2c%20Conrad%20Whitlock%2c%20David%20Pr" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./11-fun-team-building-ideas-in-charlotte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Fun Team Building Ideas in Charlotte">&larr;

He is 54 years old as of January 2024. His zodiac sign is Pisces. He later moved with his family to Concord, North Carolina.</p><p class=align-left>Darrell Wallace Sr.’s brother competed in local go-kart races in the 90s and 2000s. Growing up, Bubba spent much time at the races watching his father and uncle race. After joining his father and uncle on the races several times, his father bought a go-kart and took the young boy racing. Bubba chose racing over basketball, starting his path to becoming a <a href=#>wealthy athlete</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Darrell married Desiree in the 1990s. Darrell Wallace Sr. and Desiree Wallace had two children: Brittany Gillispie and Bubba. His son, Bubba, is a famous NASCAR driver. His daughter, Brittany, is a basketball player.

They eventually split up, which wound up working out for Bubba and Brittany’s athletic careers. Desiree has since found love again, and is reportedly married to George Lawrence. Bubba’s father has found love too; Darrell Wallace Sr.’s new wife is reportedly Julia Wallace.</p><p class=align-left>Bubba and his father had a great relationship throughout fifteen years of racing. However, they had a disagreement and a physical altercation that fractured their relationship. As Bubba recalls, his parents fought constantly before they separated. Following one such fight, Bubba was heavily affected by his father, so he drove over to his dad’s house, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">swung his fists</a> at him.</p><p class=align-left>The father-son duo stopped speaking after the incident, and Darrell was missing from many of Bubba’s races. However, their relationship started to improve after Bubba’s Netflix docu-series aired. With their repair, Darrell returned to being a presence in his son’s life, sticking by him throughout the confederate flag and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">noose incidents</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e076bbc09a25bbc9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bailey Zimmerman’s age, height, net worth, is he married?</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Bubba Wallace’s father <a href=#>is a businessman</a> and entrepreneur.

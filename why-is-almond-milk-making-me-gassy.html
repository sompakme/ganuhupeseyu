If you find that dairy doesn't agree well with your stomach, consider switching to dairy-free products such as: Coconut milk or almond milk.<h2>Who should not drink almond milk?</h2>Almond milk is naturally dairy-free, meaning it's suitable for vegans, as well as people with a dairy allergy or lactose intolerance ( 4 ). Still, you should avoid it if you're allergic to tree nuts.

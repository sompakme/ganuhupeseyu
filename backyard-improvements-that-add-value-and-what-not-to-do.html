We investigate.</p><h2 id=how-much-value-does-a-nice-backyard-add-2>How much value does a nice backyard add?</h2><p>Knowing how much value a nice backyard will add is only ever going to be an estimate – and your realtor should always be the person to ask for their expert opinion on what will work in your area before you start planning.&nbsp;</p><p>However, having a ball park figure will help you decide what to spend on landscaping to get a good return on investment. As a rough guide, a nicely landscaped garden that is low maintenance can add <strong>up to 10%</strong> to your home's value – that's potentially an extra <strong>$100,000 on a $1 million home</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth underlining that you will rarely make a profit on landscaping a backyard – but done wisely you should make your money back by adding value to your home and will certainly have a better chance of selling your home faster and for a higher price.</p><h2 id=backyard-improvements-that-add-value-2>Backyard improvements that add value</h2><p>Assuming the essential improvements in your backyard – from sound fencing to a smart patio and decking to pretty planting – have been taken care of, which are the backyard improvements to consider as potentially value-adding?

In other words, he says, it needs to be usable at least 'three out of four seasons'.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=2-an-outdoor-firepit-2>2. An outdoor firepit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTxiibRgK9uXj8LpR5riVG-1920-80.jpg><p>You will recoup around 60 to 70% of your investment on a beautifully installed firepit, says Jason Gelios of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=http://www.cmchoicea2.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Community Choice Realty</a> in Detroit, who suggests that a gas-powered fire pit installation will have the best return on investment. If you don't have the space for a permanent structure, even a firepit that can be packed away when not in use – but brought out for property viewings – can help the buyer imagine themselves using the backyard as an outdoor living room year round.</p><h2 id=3-a-swimming-pool-2>3.

'People are spending way more time at home now, and that has increased the demand for pools,' he says. He is, however, at pains to point out that you won't necessarily recoup what you spend, but that it can be a selling point when you put your home on the market – a significant bonus if your house is competing with other homes (with pools) on the market locally.</p><h2 id=4-structures-for-privacy-and-shade-2>4.

They're probably not what you expected, however. The <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2018-05-remodeling-impact-outdoor-features-05-23-2018.pdf referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Remodeling Impact Report: Outdoor Features</a> from the National Association of Realtors® found that while buyers loved the idea of a <strong>swimming pool</strong>, <strong>brand-new deck</strong>, and other luxurious backyard features, what they were actually prepared to pay more for was a garden that's impeccably landscaped and well maintained.&nbsp;</p><p>The report estimates the cost of annual mulch application, mowing of 2,835 square feet of lawn, pruning of shrubs, and planting of approximately 60 perennials or annuals to add up to an average of $3,000. It is a lot, but you will recover all of this cost –&nbsp;an incredible 100% return on investment.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a potential problem with all of this. What the report uncovers is that the majority of US home buyers are not that keen on garden maintenance, preferring the idea of moving into a home with a garden that doesn't need anything doing to it.&nbsp;</p><p>What this means in practice is that while those who do want a garden will pay more for a well-maintained one, you may also lose some buyers who are intimidated by the idea of having to do all that maintenance themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelley Martin, a realtor in San Antonio, Texas, told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.homelight.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Homelight</a> that in her experience, 'About 7 out of 10 [buyers] will say, '‘There’s no way I can maintain that,'’ or ‘'How much is that going to cost to maintain?’' or '‘Oh, my gosh, I would kill every single one of those.”'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsEHj3no2AF7QAvfNE88KE-1920-80.jpg><p>It's very different if you live in the UK, where more people are prepared to maintain their gardens over the longer term. UK home buyers will pay more for additional structures so they can enjoy their garden more, with a study by <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.ratedpeople.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Rated People</a> revealing that Brits will pay almost £8,000 ($11,000) more for a <strong>swimming pool</strong>, £5,325 ($7,378) for a <strong>home office garden room</strong>, and £5,107 ($7,076) for a<strong> garden gym</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>None of these things will make US buyers part with more of their cash, even if they do like the idea of them.

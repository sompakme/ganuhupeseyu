Byron is icey — Nutting writes that his skin feels "refrigerated" — and so controlling that he drugs his wife Hazel (Cristin Milioti) and puts a potentially lethal chip in her brain so that he can surveil her every move, hear her every thought. A standout moment of the series features Byron matter-of-factly announcing plans to kill and eat the family pet slash research subject, a squeaking dolphin. It's chilling, and very, very funny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In contrast to the character he expertly plays, Magnussen is effusively warm and welcoming, the kind of star publicists should dream about representing. He enjoys many smells, including lavender, coconut, and wood, which reminds him of a childhood spent in his father's carpentry shop (he also likes women's perfume, but it has to be good — "some women's perfumes are beautiful, and some are just like woah," he says with a laugh). And in a recent Zoom from his home in Cumming, Georgia, the actor, clad in a mustard-yellow button-down with a quarantine goatee, was eager to jump into a conversation about how his character represents the unfortunately still-relevant concept of "toxic masculinity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think Byron is weirdly the embodiment of it, the personification of it," he says. "It's like, have the nice stuff, be rich and wealthy, powerful, and all that. But what that actually creates is a smokescreen, a facade, that a young, scared little boy is hiding behind. And that's kind of what I love playing about this character, that he [represents] what society has put on men. Honestly, we're all probably just scared. And it's a fear or insecurity that we're trying to protect."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Braylen Dion</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Byron is a timely twist on a type, the sort of allegedly progressive man who obscures abusive tendencies with supposed care and concern for a partner. He gives Hazel a luxurious life inside a VR-laden palace in the desert, called "the Hub" — but she's not allowed to leave. He goes down on her every morning — but she has to log and rate her orgasms, providing detailed descriptions of every physical sensation. He says he loves her desperately and just wants to know her better — so he puts a chip in her head that violates any semblance of privacy she had left (once she figures it out, she flees to stay with her father, played by Ray Romano, and his girlfriend, a synthetic sex doll named Diane).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Magnussen makes no excuses for Byron, but he needed to find some humanity in a monster for the performance, all without sacrificing the character's intractable weirdness. He says he can "lightly empathize" with Byron's desire to openly communicate with his wife, taking care to emphasize the "lightly." His way of getting inside a sociopathic person's head was to think of a problem many people face — the inherent, frustrating walls and boundaries that come up in a relationship, the inauthenticity that is part and parcel of surviving daily life alongside another person — and push it to an extreme.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are gross elements about this, and it's really scary," he continues. "But I think what's exciting is it brings up this conversation around connection and communication."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Braylen Dion</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everybody wants to know what their partner is thinking, but most people just aren't wealthy or cartoonishly evil enough to literally make it happen (also, uh, science). As Magnussen sees it, Byron's interpretation of his relationship is one of victimhood, the way abusers often see themselves. "How am I [Byron] the bad guy when we were not communicating and I constantly asked for it?" he asks. "No one's the villain in their own story. Everyone's the hero."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps because he is both blessed and cursed with being hunky and methodical about his characters, Magnussen is used to playing jerks with quirks — he has portrayed domineering, off-kilter alphas in shows and movies like Carey Fukunaga's Maniac, Game Night, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and the "U.S.S. Callister" episode of Black Mirror, also starring Milioti. It's a funny kind of typecasting, one based much more on physicality than personality; Magnussen kept pausing our interview to ask me considerate questions about myself, speaks of his family members and co-stars with sweet reverence (on Milioti, whom he first met filming the 2012 movie The Brass Teapot: "She is the funniest, most gracious, elegant woman I know. I absolutely adore her"), and tenderly cares for the numerous fruits, herbs, and vegetables in his Georgia garden (he grows "anything you need to make a Greek salad" and has a section of plants he enthusiastically refers to as his "peppercorner").</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Billy Magnussen</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His next big career moves are in the movies. He's starring as the younger Paulie Walnuts in the highly-anticipated Sopranos prequel, The Many Saints of Newark, and has a big role in Fukunaga's upcoming James Bond film, No Time to Die (he got the call while backpacking in Vietnam; "I was like, if it's about Bond, I'm there, bro"). But he came up in the theater — he even earned a Tony nod in 2013 for his nuanced take on the himbo in Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike — and has been acting since his teens. Born in New York City, he was raised in Georgia, where his parents still live.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There were drive-by shootings happening in our neighborhood in Queens," he says. "My parents were like, we're not going to lose a kid here. So we actually moved to Miami. My other brother was born there, but it just wasn't their spot. So we were driving back up North and we visited some friends in Cumming, Georgia. And my mom was like, I like it here. My dad was like, OK. So they just plopped down, built a house."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Braylen Dion</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After years in New York and Los Angeles, Magnussen is back in Georgia, on property right next to his parents. "I was in L.A. finishing up Made for Love, and then the pandemic happened and I was quarantining there," he says. "And then just finished the show and I kind of needed a personal reset. So I moved to Georgia just to relax. And now I play in my garden, I helped renovate my mother and father's house. It's nice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Magnussen doesn't know many people in Georgia besides his immediate family, and so at the time of our April interview, he was planning a trip to California for his 36th birthday, on 4/20 (lol). He was craving some socialization. On Made For Love, Hazel throws Byron a special birthday party for two, complete with an Instagram-ready layer cake that he does not eat. But Magnussen (who, for the record, is fully vaccinated) sees things differently, like a sane person. "No meal," he says, "is done without dessert."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on as Magnussen discusses his favorite villain, a supremely cheesy pickup line, and a formative erection.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Billy Magnussen</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Who is your celebrity crush?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obama.

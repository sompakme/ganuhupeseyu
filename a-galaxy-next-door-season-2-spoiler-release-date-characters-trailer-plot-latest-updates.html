The series follows the lives of four high school students who live next to each other in a futuristic apartment complex, where each room has a portal to a different galaxy. The series explores the themes of love, friendship, adventure, and discovery, as the characters encounter various challenges and wonders in their intergalactic journeys.</p><p>The first season of A Galaxy Next Door premiered from April to June 2023 and received widespread acclaim from fans and critics alike. The series has enchanted viewers with its heart-warming love stories and mind-bending adventures, weaving together whimsical elements into a compelling plotline. The series has also been praised for its stunning animation, memorable characters, and catchy soundtrack.</p><p>With the conclusion of the first season, fans are eagerly awaiting news of a second season. Will A Galaxy Next Door get a season 2? When will it be released? What will be the plot and the cast? Where can you watch it? Here is everything you need to know about A Galaxy Next Door season 2.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_A_Galaxy_Next_Door_Get_a_Season_2></span><strong>Will A Galaxy Next Door Get a Season 2?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of November 16, 2023, there has been no official announcement regarding the renewal of the series or any details about the release date for A Galaxy Next Door season 2. However, this does not mean that the series has been canceled or that there is no hope for a continuation. The production of a sequel depends on several factors, including the popularity of both manga and anime, the availability of source material, and the production studio’s work schedule.</p><p>Both the manga and anime adaptations have received immense popularity and acclaim. The manga, serialized in Good! Afternoon since April 2020, has garnered a dedicated following among enthusiasts. The anime adaptation, brought to the screen by Asahi Production, has garnered praise from fans and critics alike. On platforms such as MyAnimeList, it holds a score of 7.1/10 based on ratings from 18,194 users, while on Crunchyroll, it has achieved a rating of 4.7/5 from 6.3k users. This overwhelming response makes a second season highly anticipated.</p><p>In terms of source material availability, the manga has been serialized across five volumes to date and continues its ongoing serialization. This ensures ample material for a potential A Galaxy Next Door season 2. The first season of the anime covered the initial 15 chapters, leaving fans eager to explore what lies ahead. Those unable to contain their curiosity are advised to start reading from chapter 16 to delve deeper into the story.</p><p>The production studio, Asahi Production, currently has a busy schedule with another series, B-Project ~Netsuretsu Love Call~, slated for release in late 2023. This may potentially affect the timing of A Galaxy Next Door’s second season. Given these circumstances, it is speculated that fans may have to wait until late 2024 or early 2025 for the highly anticipated A Galaxy Next Door season 2.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Profile></span><strong>Quick Profile</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=2><tr><td><strong>Title:</strong></td><td>A Galaxy Next Door</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. of Seasons:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. of Episodes:</strong></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Produced by:</strong></td><td>Asahi, King Records</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Music by:</strong></td><td>Takatsugu Wakabayashi</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Genre:</strong></td><td>Romance, Supernatural</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Cast:</strong></td><td>Taku Yashiro, Yū Wakui, Rina Endō</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Language:</strong></td><td>Japanese</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Episode Date:</strong></td><td>April 9, 2023</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Episode Date:</strong></td><td>June 25, 2023</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Available On:</strong></td><td><strong>Crunchyroll</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Plotlines_Plan></span><strong>Plotlines & Plan</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The plot of A Galaxy Next Door season 2 will likely follow the events of the manga from chapter 16 onwards.

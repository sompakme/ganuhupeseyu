As such, it's no surprise that the show takes some extreme liberties with the true story of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g32525297/who-is-catherine-the-great-empress-of-russia/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Catherine the Great, Russia's longest-running female ruler" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Catherine the Great, Russia's longest-running female ruler</a>—and it makes no bones about doing so, billing itself as "an occasionally true story."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Starring Elle Fanning in the title role, the show follows the rise of Catherine as she arrives in Russia as a teenager, naively excited for her arranged wedding night with Peter III (Nicholas Hoult), the heir to the Russian throne ... and goes on to overthrow her husband, mastermind a plot to have him killed, and ascend the throne after his assassination. So exactly how true is this stranger-than-fiction series of events? Spoiler: a lot more true than you might suspect. Here's a primer on the real story of Peter III's assassination.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Catherine and Peter's marriage was fraught from the start.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Catherine, who was born Sophie Frederica Auguste, came to Russia with her ambitious mother who had the express intention of finding her a good marriage. The teenage Catherine impressed then-Empress Elizabeth Petrovna so much that Elizabeth arranged for her to be married to her nephew and heir, Peter III. There was only one downside to this match; Catherine and Peter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.livescience.com/42006-catherine-the-great.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reportedly hated each other" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">reportedly hated each other</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/peter-iii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography.com class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Biography.com</a> has a truly savage summary of the situation:</p>The marriage, politically arranged by Peter's aunt, was a disaster from the start. Catherine was a young woman of prodigious intellect, while Peter was a child in a man's body.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It took eight years for the couple to have a child, which at the time was highly unusual, and their eldest son Paul was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g32525297/who-is-catherine-the-great-empress-of-russia/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rumored to be illegitimate" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">rumored to be illegitimate</a>. Catherine herself later confirmed this, claiming that she and Peter had never actually consummated their marriage, and both were known to have numerous extramarital affairs.</p><img alt="hulu 'the great'" title="hulu 'the great'" width=1352 height=754 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thegreat-1589680279.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hulu</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Catherine became suspicious of Peter's intentions once he took the throne.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Peter III ascended as the Tsar of Russia in January of 1762–but by then, Catherine had already learned a lot about leadership on her own time, and she was not impressed by her husband's capabilities. “When she was grand duchess, in a marriage that wasn’t working, and having nothing to do at court except please the empress and stay out of trouble, she spent a lot of time reading,” The Great historical adviser Virginia Rounding told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5696556/catherine-the-great-history/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Time class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Time</a>. “She trained herself, learning and beginning to form the idea that she could do better than her husband.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Partially as a result of her new education, Catherine began to question much of Peter's decision-making, and she wasn't alone. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/peter-iii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Her memoirs" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Her memoirs</a> would later depict him as "an idiot and a drunkard, prone to brutal practical jokes and interested only in playing soldier." He was a deeply unpopular ruler, and after less than half a year a substantial faction had already begun conspiring to overthrow him. Catherine, reportedly fearing for her personal safety, was one of the driving forces behind the insurgence, along with her lover Grigory Orlov.</p><img alt="portrait of the tsar peter iii of russia 1728 1762" title="Portrait Of The Tsar Peter Iii Of Russia 1728-1762" width=732 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/portrait-of-the-tsar-peter-iii-of-russia-1762-found-in-the-news-photo-1589695330.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Heritage Images</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Peter was forced to abdicate just six months after he took the throne.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Peter was officially overthrown on June 28, 1762 when <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a29460240/catherine-the-great-coup-killed-husband-true-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Catherine and Orlov mounted a coup" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Catherine and Orlov mounted a coup</a>, leading 14,000 soldiers on horseback to the Winter Palace and forcing Peter to sign abdication paperwork.

It's widely believed that he was assassinated behind bars, and that Alexei Orlov, Grigory's brother, was the killer. What remains most unclear is whether Catherine herself was aware of any assassination plot–or indeed whether she ordered it–there's even some evidence that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/peter-iii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Peter committed suicide" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Peter committed suicide</a>.

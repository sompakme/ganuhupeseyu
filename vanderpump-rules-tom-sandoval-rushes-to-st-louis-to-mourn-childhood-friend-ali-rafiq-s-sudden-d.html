I'm not sure what it is," Rabia revealed. "But you know, my parents are really comforted by talking to his friends. So, it's really nice of them and I hope everybody can just find peace with, with their stuff because you never know when it's gonna be your last day."</p><h2>COMING TOGETHER</h2><p>The St. Louis native's sister is referring to the whole drama that's unfolded after the <a href=#>Scandoval affair</a> broke.</p><p>When asked what it was like to see Ariana, 37, and Tom, 39, both honor their late friend despite everything they're going through, Rabia said that Ali would've been "really happy" to see all the "sweet" messages.</p><p>"Oh, it's really sweet that they both cared for him so much and he cared for them so much, and he really respected and he was so proud of them," she shared.</p><p>"I've been showing my mom some of the Instagram tagged posts and all these memories that people have with him. It's really nice because, like, there's all these pictures that we've never seen.</p><p>"It's helping. Like, it makes my parents feel better knowing that he was so loved."</p><p>Rabia told The U.S. Sun that the family is planning on having a celebration of life event in the next couple of weeks for his friends from Los Angeles who couldn't make it this past weekend like Ariana and <a href=#>Kristen Doute</a>, who also shared a touching tribute on Instagram.</p><h2>'CAN'T BE REAL'</h2><p>After Ali was found dead at his home in St. Louis on Friday, his sister said that the family is still searching for answers on what caused his sudden death.</p><p>"We don't actually have a cause of death yet. I know that they default put organ failure on his death certificate, but that's just kind of the default that they put when they don't have a straight answer," Rabia disclosed.</p><p>"When we found him, he was already gone. And there's no indicators of any clues or anything like that.</p><p>"So, we had a toxicology test, but I understand that it can take some time to get those results.</p><p>"We just don't know anything. We have no clue whatsoever, so we'd love some answers, you know."</p><p>The Vanderpump Rules cast is also just as perplexed by their friend's tragic loss.</p><p>The <a href=#>Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras</a> frontman shared multiple photos with his close pal and wrote: "The love I have for you is way beyond words I will carry u forever in my heart.</p><p>"Always cherishing the beautiful memories, uncontrollable laughter, and epic experiences we had together. You were My best friend, my brother. I’ll catch u on the next sunrise."</p><p>Meanwhile, Ariana shared a throwback photo with Ali and wrote: "She wrote in the caption: "I keep wanting to text you. It feels like this can't even be real. We were just planning your trip to LA.</p><p>"Talking about our futures and all the things we were looking forward to. I miss our talks about life. I miss sending each other cat memes... I love you always and forever. I'm grateful for the moments we spent together and for the love and friendship you showed me over the last ten years."</p><h2>'AFFECTED SO MANY'</h2><p>All the outpouring messages have made their way to the Rafiqs, who have learned just how many people whose life he touched within these past few days.</p><p>Rabia told The U.S. Sun: "He was just like super outgoing, super friendly. Like, he was the guy that if you needed a connection, he always knew someone. He would put others before himself.</p><p>"We never realized that he knew so many and that he affected so many. I know it's easy for me to say because he is my brother, but, yeah, I really feel like that it's such a big loss for St. Louis."</p><p>Rabia mentioned that the family is asking for any donations from anyone he's touched be "made anywhere in his name."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/cant-real-vanderpump-rules-star-819151274.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/tom-s-agony-vanderpump-rules-819676019.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/tom-s-agony-vanderpump-rules-819683592.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYW1%2Bd4SYaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuwM6mZKyZnpm8t63LZqqtZZykwqq%2FjJ2cmqyYYq6ttYyrmJ%2BhoWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html&text=Vanderpump%20Rules%20Tom%20Sandoval%20rushes%20to%20St%20Louis%20to%20mourn%20childhood%20friend%20Ali%20Rafiqs%20sudden%20d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html&title=Vanderpump%20Rules%20Tom%20Sandoval%20rushes%20to%20St%20Louis%20to%20mourn%20childhood%20friend%20Ali%20Rafiqs%20sudden%20d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html&title=Vanderpump%20Rules%20Tom%20Sandoval%20rushes%20to%20St%20Louis%20to%20mourn%20childhood%20friend%20Ali%20Rafiqs%20sudden%20d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html&title=Vanderpump%20Rules%20Tom%20Sandoval%20rushes%20to%20St%20Louis%20to%20mourn%20childhood%20friend%20Ali%20Rafiqs%20sudden%20d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-rushes-to-st-louis-to-mourn-childhood-friend-ali-rafiq-s-sudden-d.html&description=Vanderpump%20Rules%20Tom%20Sandoval%20rushes%20to%20St%20Louis%20to%20mourn%20childhood%20friend%20Ali%20Rafiqs%20sudden%20d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./which-background-color-is-best-for-eyes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which background color is best for eyes?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steel-guitarist-sneaky-pete-kleinow-dies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steel guitarist Sneaky Pete Kleinow dies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

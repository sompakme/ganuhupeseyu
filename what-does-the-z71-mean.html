The Chevy Silverado Z71 package is <b>an optional upgrade to add to your Silverado 1500 to enhance the pickup's off-road capabilities</b>. The Z71 package is Chevy's signature off-road package and is well-respected in off-road communities.</span></span><h2>What makes a Chevy truck a Z71?</h2>The Z71 Package gives truck buyers a Silverado that is built to be ready for anything. The brushed metal sill plates and underbody transfer case shield give the Silverado added durability that will give you peace of mind that you aren't roughing up your pickup too much.<h2>What is included in the Z71 package?</h2>The Z71 Off-Road Package is available on almost every Silverado (standard on Trail Boss models; not available on Custom) and includes the Autotrac 2-speed transfer case, twin-tube Rancho® shocks (Rancho monotube shocks on Trail Boss), a metal underbody shield, a heavy-duty air filter, an industry-first air filter ...<h2>What is the difference between LTZ and Z71?</h2>While the LT and LTZ are trim levels, the Z71 is something different. The Z71 is a performance/offroad package that is sold as a separate package options for both the LT and LTZ trim levels. The Z71 package includes upgraded shocks, all terain tires, bigger wheels, and various other features built for offroad use.<h2>Are all Z71 trucks 4X4?</h2>Z71 colorado/canyons can be either 4X4 or 2WD. 2WD Z71's have torsion bar suspension. Non Z71 trucks that are 2WD are non torsion bar. Non Z71 trucks that are 4X4 are torsion bar.<h2>What is Z71?</h2><p></p><h2>What does LTZ stand for?</h2>LTZ: LTZ Meaning. LTZ stands for “luxury touring z”, with “z” symbolizing the next step up from the “LT” trim. Davenport drivers may notice numbers with an LTZ trim, like “LTZ1” or “1LTZ”. Because the LTZ label is only available on higher-up trims, there aren't as many Chevy models with the LTZ label.<h2>What does the Z stand for in Z71?</h2>Most of the time, they are for an RPO code for the suspension. Z28 was the RPO code for the Trans-Am spec Camaro. Z71 gets you an offroading suspension. Z06 was a special suspension for race-type Corvette from the 60's. Z24 and Z34 were spin-offs of the Z28's performance image.<h2>Can I add a Z71 package to my truck?</h2>For the Silverado 1500, the Z71 package is a standalone option. It is available to add to most trim levels and comes standard on the Custom Trail Boss and LT Trail Boss models.<h2>Is Z71 suspension stiffer?</h2>I do know on 2017 Colorado according to suspension parts lists, the main suspension difference was only in the front struts and springs being a bit stiffer. Rear leafs for a given trim/model level were the same. Other than that, the stock Z71 Kevlar tires also contribute to a bit stiffer ride.<h2>How much does a Z71 package cost?</h2>Z71 Off-Road and Protection package (prices start at $1,770; available in LT, RST, and LTZ): a two-speed transfer case, a locking rear differential (if not already included), hill descent control, all-terrain tires, skid plates, Rancho shock absorbers, and an upgraded air filter.<h2>Is the Z71 a V-8?</h2>The main difference between the 2015 LTZ Z71 and LT Z71 is that the latter comes with a 4.3L V6 engine, whereas the LTZ Z71 is equipped with an even more powerful 5.3L V8.<h2>How fast is a Chevy Silverado Z71?</h2>Top Speed of the Chevrolet Silverado<p>The Chevrolet Silverado has a top speed of 114 miles per hour, an impressive speed for a truck. The Silverado is ready to blow away the competition in several ways, from its performance to its steady endurance.</p><h2>What does AT4 stand for GMC?</h2>AT4 stands for All-Terrain 4WD. This is a trim level that GMC first introduced with the GMC Sierra 1500 back in 2019. It was a more premium trim and fell between the SLT and Denali versions. Now, the AT4 trim is available on other vehicles besides the Sierra 1500.<h2>Where did Z71 originate?</h2>GM didn't call it Z71, but that's what the package was. It took until 1992 for GM to realize that shoppers were wise to the RPO code, at which time the automaker started slapping Z71 stickers on the rear quarter panels of its full-size Chevy and GMC pickups.<h2>Is LT better than LS?</h2>The Difference Between LS and LT<p>The LS will add on extra amenities – often nicer interior or exterior upgrades or more premium technology. The LT follows after the LS, offering even better features at a slightly higher MSRP. While these features vary from model to model, you'll notice a more luxurious feel overall.</p><h2>What does LS stand for?</h2>In a car engine, LS stands for luxury sport, meaning it is majorly used in high-end cars that offer great performance like the Chevrolet. In a Chevy, the LS engine is the main V8 mainly used in General Motors' line of rear-wheel-drive cars.<h2>Which is better LT or LTZ?</h2>“LT” stands for Luxury Touring. Price-wise, LT Chevrolet models are more cost-effective than LTZ, because they include fewer high-end features. Generally, LT models have features like cloth seating and body-color door handles, whereas the LTZ models get leather upholstery and chrome door handles.<h2>What does LS in Chevy mean?</h2>LS is short for Luxury Sport, and is the base trim for many Chevy vehicles. These vehicles are called Luxury Sport because they provide both the sense of luxury and sporty versatility you expect from a Chevy Truck or SUV; just because it's a base trim doesn't mean it can't come with amazing features and performance.<h2>Is a Z71 4 wheel drive or 2 wheel drive?</h2>Most commonly, the Z71 package is offered on trim levels with four-wheel drive. This is because the entire purpose of the package is to enhance off-road performance, in which case a 4×4 suspension is important. 4WD simply means a truck has the ability to send engine power to all four wheels on the vehicle.<h2>When did Chevy start making Z71?</h2>In 1988, the first official special Z71 package appeared on Chevrolet's new-generation full-size pickup trucks, melding capability-enhancing components such as special shocks and chassis protection equipment with visual distinction, including the iconic Z71 rear fender decals.<h2>Are Z71 2WD or 4WD?</h2>Z71 is 4WD off-road option. The option includes skid plates and badging. Someone else on this thread stated it also included locking differentials. The Z66 option is the same but for 2WD.<h2>What is the difference between trail boss and Z71?</h2>So, the biggest difference between the two packages is that the 2019 Silverado Trail Boss gets a two-inch lift with monotube shocks and those awesome black wheels, while the Z71 does not.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1llKSytHnToZxmsmdmeq6xwKc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html&text=What%20does%20the%20Z71%20mean%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html&title=What%20does%20the%20Z71%20mean%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html&title=What%20does%20the%20Z71%20mean%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html&title=What%20does%20the%20Z71%20mean%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-the-z71-mean.html&description=What%20does%20the%20Z71%20mean%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-standard-height-for-laundry-room-cabinets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the standard height for laundry room cabinets?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./smallpox-and-the-photos-anti-vaxxers-don-t-want-you-to-see.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Smallpox and the photos anti-vaxxers don't want you to see">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

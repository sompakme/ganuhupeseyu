He subsequently disclosed that he and his wife, Madelyn “Maddie” Stapleton, were going through a divorce at the time of the incident. Maddie began to feature on his YouTube channel as his profession grew in popularity. They posted footage of themselves playing Minecraft and The Sims 3 on YouTube.</p><p></p><h3>Is SSundee still in a relationship with Maddie?</h3><p>He filmed the movie at the headquarters of DoubleJump, the firm that he founded. According to him, he and Maddie had split, and that his life was in God’s hands. He said that he would return to YouTube when God instructed him to do so. SSundee declared at the end of 2018 that he would no longer be making Minecraft videos and would instead focus only on Fortnite.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>As a result, the issue arises as to whether SSundee served in the military?</h3><p>He was serving in the United States Air Force at the time, and he was also posting YouTube videos to his channel. On February 14, 2013, his military service came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><h3>In the same vein, why did SSundee decide to quit playing Minecraft?</h3><p>Ssundee is a YouTuber that has around 11 million followers at the time of writing. He gained the majority of his followers through participating in the popular video game Minecraft. Ssundee, on the other hand, has abandoned Minecraft in order to play a more relevant game, Fortnite: Battle Royale. This implies that many of his devoted followers will no longer be able to access the stuff they came to see.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is Crainer and Thea still in a relationship in 2019?</h3><p>Benjamin Dreyer Vestergrd (born December 12, 1994 (1994-12-12) [age 25]), best known online as Crainer, previously MrCrainer, is a Danish gaming YouTuber who specialises in competitive gaming.

He mostly plays Minecraft, but he also dabbles in a variety of other popular video games from time to time. He was a member of the TeamCrafted gaming group. His estimated net worth is $17 million, the majority of which comes from his YouTube channel.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the name of Ssundee’s son?</h3><p>Ian Marcus Stapleton was born on December 2, 1988, in the state of California, United States of America. Neither his parents nor his siblings have provided us with much information. He had previously been married to a lady called Maddie, but the couple separated in the year 2012 and never remarried. They are the parents of a kid called Colton, who was born to them.</p><p></p><h3>What is the age of SSundee 2019?</h3><p>An American YouTuber with the name of SSundee, Ian Marcus Stapleton (born December 6, 1989) is 29 years old and comes from the state of Washington.

In an emotional video posted on 17 March 2013, SSundee admitted that he and his wife, Madelyn, had separated in 2012, which had resulted in him not being active on YouTube during that period. He has a son called Colton who was born to him and his first wife.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What caused the dissolution of Team Crafted?</h3><p>Setosorcerer quit Team Crafted in early November, citing the group’s desire to do real-life skits on a live broadcast that was later pulled down by SkyDoesMinecraft as the reason for his departure. As of right now, Seto and the others are not at odds with one another. On March 2, 2014, they announced that xRpMx13 had been added to the Team Crafted roster.</p><p></p><h3>‘Can you tell me how much money PewDiePie makes?</h3><p>‘ PewDiePie was also ranked the highest-paid YouTuber by Forbes in 2013, with his yearly revenue topping $15 million in that year.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Minecraft still alive and well?</h3><p>Minecraft is not extinct; there are still a large number of people that like playing the game. The game, on the other hand, is still very much alive.</p><p></p><h3>Is the PC version of Minecraft on its way out?</h3><p>Minecraft is not on its way out, to put it bluntly. There are almost 70,000,000 gamers across all platforms when all platforms are merged. That translates to at least one copy for every 100 individuals on the planet. Despite being available on every current gaming platform, the game has continuously been among the best-selling titles on each and every one of them.</p><p></p><h3>Is Minecraft on its way out?</h3><p>If there is a remote possibility that Minecraft may be erased, the answer is straightforward: Minecraft will not be destroyed. The game isn’t over as long as there is still someone playing it, so keep playing!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is Minecraft a superior game than Fortnite?</h3><p>Minecraft is a sandbox game that combines elements of survival and construction. Fortnite is a battle royale/team survival game that incorporates construction components into the gameplay. They are not really comparable since there are just not enough overlapping components between them to provide a meaningful comparison. One may be preferred above the other by a particular individual, but there is no way to determine which is “better.”</p><p></p><h3>What kind of recording does Ssundee make use of?</h3><p>Ssundee utilises Audacity to record his audio tracks, much like the majority of other makers, including us here at FilmToolKit. Audacity is pretty much the only programme available for PC audio recording, and it is free. Despite the fact that the programme is so lightweight, it is utilised by experts all across the globe.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the number of persons that play Minecraft?</h3><p>There are 91 million individuals in the world.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6doJ1lo6jCr7DEnmSbqpWWuG7Bz2auoqyYYrqisMOinGegpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html&text=Did%20SSundee%20break%20up%20with%20Maddie%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html&title=Did%20SSundee%20break%20up%20with%20Maddie%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html&title=Did%20SSundee%20break%20up%20with%20Maddie%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html&title=Did%20SSundee%20break%20up%20with%20Maddie%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-ssundee-break-up-with-maddie.html&description=Did%20SSundee%20break%20up%20with%20Maddie%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gladiators-hunter-has-a-famous-secret-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gladiators' Hunter has a famous secret girlfriend!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebrity-birthdays-pierre-casiraghi-turns-27.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrity birthdays: Pierre Casiraghi turns 27">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Her first husband was Jimmy Gulzar, the Dutch dancer, whom she married in 1998. They had a daughter before divorcing in 2000. Their relationship took a dark turn as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jimmy attacked</a> his wife's sister Danielle and got prosecuted for it. Brown <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">won custody</a> over their child and had to pay alimony settlement to her ex-husband.</p><p class=align-left>One of her most famous relationships was with the actor Eddie Murphy, whom she began dating in 2006. Eddie became the father of her second child. Mel B and Eddie Murphy love story was brief as they separated in 2007.

Belafonte, in return, accused her of "wiping out" all of her Spice Girls money due to her luxurious lifestyle.</p><h3>Mel B nanny scandal</h3><p class=align-left>The ex-nanny of the star, Lorraine Gilles, got caught up in her divorce from Stephen Belafonte and shared some things about their private relationship.

She also said that there was a misconception that she got pregnant with Stephen's baby when in reality, it was with some random man that she had a one-night stand with, and Brown paid for her abortion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24f635254a5b125a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The chronicle of the life and career of Keri Russell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The former nanny said that she wishes her ex-employer and lover treated her with respect like she did over the past seven years.

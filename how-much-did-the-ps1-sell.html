Until now</h2><p></p><h2>How much is a PS6?</h2>PlayStation 6 Price<p>As for the price, the upcoming PlayStation 6 is expected to cost around $599.99 due to its predicted advanced features.

However, that itself became an issue due to the massive cost it would pose to the company.<h2>Did The PS3 Fail?</h2>The PS3's disappointing performance led to Microsoft's console gaining a lot of ground – both critically and commercially – and becoming a major competitor. As the saying goes, first impressions count. And it was this that led many industry folk to declare that the PS3 had lost Sony this particular console war.<h2>Did Xbox outsell PS4?</h2>The PlayStation 4 outsold the Xbox One by 76,811 units.

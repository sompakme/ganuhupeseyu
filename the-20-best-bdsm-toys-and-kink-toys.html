"Kink gives people an opportunity to explore themselves and their relationships on many different levels."</p><p>Kink is essentially any unconventional sexual practice and includes everything from bondage to roleplay to dominant/submissive experimentation.

"The definition that I’ve adopted to explain sex positivity is, 'All sex is good sex as long as it’s consensual and pleasurable.' This simple definition challenges some of the biggest misconceptions about kink—namely that kink is weird, strange or perverted (this is a word I particularly dislike!)."</p><p>If, like many of us, you've indulged or thought about indulging in kink in the bedroom, then you've come to the right place.

She elaborates, "When you are safely and properly engaging in kinky activities, you have communication about what is and isn't okay between partners. There is communication in place so that everyone is heard throughout the experiences, and there is trust: Trust that someone will not take advantage of the situation or you, trust in knowing that the situation will play out as previously discussed, and trust in the partner."</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://drhollyrichmond.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Holly Richmond</a>, who is a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.dameproducts.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtvqVBhCVARIsAFUxcRs9x9Qw3rNX8Ej8VThiXdf21YZ3w2YMFVEtOW7Q4yxL-NAw0p6Gi7AaAqMmEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dameproducts.com%2F%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjwtvqVBhCVARIsAFUxcRs9x9Qw3rNX8Ej8VThiXdf21YZ3w2YMFVEtOW7Q4yxL-NAw0p6Gi7AaAqMmEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fsex-love%2Fkink-toys-bdsm-toys" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - dameproducts.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Dame</a> <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dameproducts.com/pages/dame-clinical-board referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dameproducts.com%2Fpages%2Fdame-clinical-board&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fsex-love%2Fkink-toys-bdsm-toys" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - dameproducts.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Clinical Board</a> medical advisor, somatic psychotherapist, licensed marriage & family therapist, and certified sex therapist, agrees that kink seamlessly blends into any consensual, affectionate, and loving relationship, and refutes the assumption that kink is necessarily dangerous, saying that, when coupled with thorough communication, "kink is the opposite of dangerous. Kink is thoughtful, transparent, and consent-driven. Because of copious amounts of clear communication, the possibilities for pleasure are endless."</p><p>She goes on to point out that for long-term couples, kink can be an essential aspect of partners' sexual repertoire, because it "offers the novelty that keeps things hot. Novelty is the seat of human desire, and for the couple in long-term relationships, finding things that are new or provide a sense of adventure in the bedroom (or elsewhere!) isn’t always easy. Kink is an ideal solution for bringing freshness back to a solid relationship where things have, perhaps, gotten a little stale."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-kink-and-safety><span>Kink and Safety</span></h3><p>Although kink is fabulous when safe and consensual, as with all sexual activities, it's important to practice safety and to consistently check in with one's partner(s) during sex—especially with acts like pain-play, BDSM, and role-play.&nbsp;</p><p>"Submission never means 'non-consensual' or 'reluctant,'" says Rowntree, encouraging partners to communicate with complete openness before, during, and after sex, and suggesting that those interested in "serious BDSM play" take classes and connect with the BDSM community in order to thoroughly educate themselves on ensuring safety.</p><p>One well-known way of establishing sexual boundaries within kink, for example, is using safe words.</p><p>"When people play with power and sensation in a sexual, body-based way, safe words ensure that the sensations are always pleasurable rather than hurtful. For some people, pain is part of their sexual repertoire, but pain is also an essential part of how they experience pleasure. Anything that feels hurtful or especially uncomfortable—physically or emotionally—has the capacity to be paused or stopped with a safe word," says Dr. Richmond. "Be sure to choose a word that isn’t “stop” or “no” since those are often part of power dynamics or role-playing scenes. My clients tend to choose a word that is unlikely to come up in a sexual scenario, like 'violin,' 'poddle,' or 'sidewalk.'"</p><p>Sexologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.velvetlipssexed.com/about-marla referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Marla Renee Stewart,</a> M.A., sexpert for sexual wellness brand <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://loversstores.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1587397&u=1338591&m=99778&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=http%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=loversstores.com data-merchant-id=282463 data-merchant-url=loversstores.com data-merchant-network=Generic>Lovers</a>, adds that safe words don't even need to be words—especially if your kink of choice involves gagging or if you have difficulty verbalizing yourself during sex. She suggests, "You can do things like hold your hand out, a fist up, or even tapping out."</p><p>Finally, be sure to communicate with your partner(s) after sex as well—particularly if you really liked or disliked something that they did.

"For instance, blindfolding a partner with a scarf, or tying their hands together - that is kink. Tickling them with a feather is kink, but so are the more elaborate forms like rope bondage, suspension, flogging, etc, which should never be attempted without proper training."</p><p>So if you and/or your partner(s) are new to kink and want to start with something on the tame side, check out some of our favorite products below that are perfect for the kink-curious.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Dame The Power Trip Kit" data-url=https://www.dameproducts.com/collections/all/products/the-power-trip referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dameproducts.com%2Fcollections%2Fall%2Fproducts%2Fthe-power-trip&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fsex-love%2Fkink-toys-bdsm-toys" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - dameproducts.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pVJriCUKcs7QBiSLycRtAV-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label versus__label">Best Set for Sex Toy Beginners</span></p></a><p>Dame The Power Trip Kit</p><p>Dr. Richmond advises, "As you begin to explore, remember bigger, faster or stronger is not always better!"

This leather spanking paddle combines impact play with electrostimulation by incorporating three metal conductor pads into the paddle, which safely administer a topical electric current to the receiver. Reviewers say it’s great for both experienced users as well as those who are new to electrostimulation, and that it’s great for foreplay.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>good for different experience levels; can be used as a normal paddle and for electrostimulation; easy to clean</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>some users say it can be confusing to set up; should not be used on those who have heart conditions or are pregnant</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"This literally awoke every nerve ending, every time the plates and paddle came in contact with my buttocks it gave a short but deeply erotic tingle that ran through my skin and gave me immense pleasure. It is not recommended using this particular paddle for heavy spanking but instead alternating the level of power...Overall, this has to be my favorite ElectraStim toy. I love the versatility and how this amazing piece of equipment can turn from an ordinary paddle to a paddle of electric ecstasy in just a few seconds...As with all ElectraStim equipment, you must be extremely careful when using, the paddle for example cannot be used above the waist or with people who have heart conditions or who are pregnant...Be it a heavy BDSM session or some erotic foreplay, this amazing paddle brings highly stimulating sensations into the bedroom and is not to be missed out on." -Lovehoney</p><a href=# data-model-name="Sportsheets Leather Collar and Leash Set" data-url=https://loversstores.com/collections/collars/products/leather-collar-and-leash-set referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1587397&u=1338591&m=99778&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fcollections%2Fcollars%2Fproducts%2Fleather-collar-and-leash-set" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=loversstores.com data-merchant-id=282463 data-merchant-url=loversstores.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYa7ocAQY3o2Ej7G8Q4uDN-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label versus__label">Best Collar and Leash for Kink and BDSM</span></p></a><p>Sportsheets Leather Collar and Leash Set</p><p>Leather collars and leashes are among the most popular and iconic sex toys for kink and BDSM play, and a great addition to the sex collection of anyone involved in intense dominant/submissive roleplaying.

These hypoallergenic, body-safe candles allow one partner to drip hot wax onto the other, resulting in a stimulating sensation that doesn’t leave a burn or lasting mark (any redness should go away in 12 to 24 hours). Then, the wax can be used as massage oil once it cools down.

Having no idea where the wax is going to fall and sting really helps add to the excitement. The candles leave a nice red mark that lasts for a good few minutes. This looks amazing from both the subs and doms position...As for cleaning up afterwards, It could not be any easier! All you have to do is peel it off your skin.

There are communicative, positive, and fun ways to talk about your fantasies, though—without making your partner feel attacked or defensive.&nbsp;</p><p>"It is most effective to share what you like and what you would like to explore, rather than pointing out aspects of the sexual relationship that you don’t like or are bored with," says Dr. Richmond. The goal is to help your partner stay engaged rather than get defensive. Leading with curiosity and kindness almost always ensures this."</p><p>For instance, she recommends opening the conversation by asking one's partner if there is anything they would like to try. "By asking them what they are interested in exploring, you will also have a chance to share," she explains. "For example, 'I’ve been really enjoying when we’ve played with different toys, and was thinking I'd like to try _______. What do you think? What are you enjoying most about our sex life right now? Is there anything you’ve been wanting to try?'"</p><p>In the same vein, Stewart suggests bringing the subject up casually or teasingly, with phrases like, "I love how strong your hands are. I think they would be great giving me a spanking. Don't you think?"</p><p>You can even explore the possibilities within kink together, by looking through kink activities or kinky porn online together.

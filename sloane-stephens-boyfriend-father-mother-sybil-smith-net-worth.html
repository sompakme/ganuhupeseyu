Moreover, she has also managed to get almost 10 career titles with her racquet.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His family: father, mother (Sybil Smith)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sloane Stephens life has not been without her tragedy especially when you look at her family life.&nbsp;As stated earlier, her mother raised her as a single mother after her father abandoned them when she was just a child.</span></p><p><span>After her dad left her mom who was in her after being an American swimmer, she later met and married Sheldon Farrell who would play an important role in her life as a tennis player as he also played the sport.</span></p><p><span>The first tragedy that struck Stephens was the death of Sheldon Farrell when she was around 14 years old.&nbsp;The next would be the death of her biological father, whom she lost in a car accident in 2009. Before his death, John Stephens was able to mend broken fences with his daughter and had a good relationship with her.</span></p><p><span>While the sport is ever-present in his family, his brother, Shawn Farrel, loves it too.&nbsp;He is both a football player and a baseball player, but he has yet to make a difference in both sports.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Sloane Stephens’ Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>When it comes to her relationships, the young beautiful tennis star hasn’t dated many men in the past.&nbsp;Instead, she’s only been in two so far.&nbsp;Her first relationship was with fellow tennis star and Olympic gold medalist, Jack Sock.&nbsp;The relationship between the two which started in 2013 was quite open and public, but it didn’t last beyond 2014.</span></p><p><span>The next person to be her boyfriend is American footballer, Jozy Altidore, whom she started dating in 2017. Much like her first relationship, Sloane and Jozy, born November 6, 1989, are very open about their relationship and, to the second half of 2018, they were still a couple together.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Not necessarily the greatest tennis player out there, Sloane Stephens is a bank of surprise, on the court.&nbsp;While this made her very interesting to watch play and follow, it also saved her time.</span></p><p><span>Making it one of Forbesen magazine’s top 30 30s of 2018, his net worth can be estimated at over $10 million.&nbsp;Although some sources valued her at $4 million, the tennis beauty has earned nearly $10 million in career prize money.&nbsp;More so, she has signed several contracts with brands such as Precision Nutrition and Under Armour.&nbsp;She was also a global ambassador for American Express.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirnKSur7GMrKueqJiau7R5waiwn6qZmrulecWaq6GdomK6sMDHnqlmq6mXtq150qagraBdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html&text=Sloane%20Stephens%20Boyfriend%2c%20Father%2c%20Mother%20%28Sybil%20Smith%29%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html&title=Sloane%20Stephens%20Boyfriend%2c%20Father%2c%20Mother%20%28Sybil%20Smith%29%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html&title=Sloane%20Stephens%20Boyfriend%2c%20Father%2c%20Mother%20%28Sybil%20Smith%29%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html&title=Sloane%20Stephens%20Boyfriend%2c%20Father%2c%20Mother%20%28Sybil%20Smith%29%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsloane-stephens-boyfriend-father-mother-sybil-smith-net-worth.html&description=Sloane%20Stephens%20Boyfriend%2c%20Father%2c%20Mother%20%28Sybil%20Smith%29%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tasty-trixie-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tasty Trixie Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-cabral-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Cabral Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The battery may include a simple circular label with the date in the following format: “9/13,” which is September 13, if you’re fortunate. Other batteries, on the other hand, should have a plastic strip with a code printed on it.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is there a lifetime guarantee on Interstate Batteries?</h3><p>Interstate Batteries are covered by a nationwide warranty.

In order to avoid overfilling the vent well tubes, the maximum fill level should be 1/8″ below the bottom of each tube.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How can I find out whether my battery is still under warranty?</h3><p>Here on the Exide Care website, you may get additional information about the Batteries/Home UPS that you have registered with them.

A automobile battery has a lifespan of between two and five years on average. Because you live in a cold area, if you reside in the northern United States, the longevity of your automobile battery will be significantly extended.</p><p></p><h3>What does the date on a battery have to do with anything?</h3><p>An expired battery indicates that the battery’s manufacturer is no longer able to guarantee that the battery will have a full charge or will last for the whole duration of its life. More exactly, battery expiry dates are determined by the point at which the battery’s total self-discharge exceeds 20% of its capacity.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the location of the date code on a vehicle battery?</h3><p>If the battery is for an automotive, the date code is normally imprinted on the top of the battery.

Problems with the electrical system.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the age of my battery?</h3><p>At the moment the battery is sent from the manufacturing facility, date codes are carved into the cover of every Interstate battery that is manufactured.
